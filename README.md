## Background
The proposed project aims to address concerns related to the removal of pharmaceutical pollutants from wastewater, a critical environmental challenge due to the increasing prevalence of these pollutants. 
Pharmaceuticals as emerging pollutants pose significant risks to both human health and the aquatic ecosystem. Their microscopic nature allows them to often go undetected, thereby complicating efforts to mitigate their impact.

Biochar produced waste materials could be used as a promising adsorbent for the remediation of pharmaceutical pollutants. 
The specific questions to be answered include: How effective is biochar, compared to other adsorbents in removing various pharmaceutical micropollutants from wastewater? 
What are the optimal conditions under which biochar can maximize the adsorption of these pollutants? 
Additionally, the research aims to understand the relationship between the properties of biochar and its efficiency in removing different types of pharmaceuticals. 
Furthermore, publicly available software will be developed for predicting biochar effectiveness in removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater.

The proposed problem is intrinsically linked to the theme of water security, a central focus of the Summer School 2024. 
Water security involves ensuring sustainable access to safe and clean water, a necessity that is compromised by the presence of pharmaceutical pollutants. 
The research into biochar as a cost-effective and eco-friendly adsorbent aligns with the goals of water security by providing a viable solution for clean water and waste valorization. 
It addresses the urgent need for innovative and sustainable technologies to mitigate water pollution, thereby safeguarding both environmental and public health.
The proposed project contributes to the broader goal of maintaining and improving water quality, a key aspect of water security.
